# Analysis of Kickstarter Fundraisers

### Asked to gain insight based on the given data set of over 4000 entertainment based fundraisers. Looking for trends that could improve the successfulness of our customer Louise's play "Fever."

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date
#### There appears to be a clear correlation with successful kickstarters launching in early summer and failed kickstarters launching in the early winter months. I insist that this is due to the general public having less disposable income around the holidays in November and December. 
- The main takeaway for our request is that launching the kickstarter in early summer will give an advantage to Louise's play being successfully funded.
