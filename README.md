# Analysis of Kickstarter Fundraisers

### I was asked to gain insight based on the given data set of over 4000 entertainment based fundraisers. Looking for trends that could improve the successfulness of our customer Louise's play "Fever."

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date
#### There appears to be a clear correlation with successful kickstarters launching in early summer and failed kickstarters launching in the early winter months. I insist that this is due to the general public having less disposable income around the holidays in November and December. 
#### The main takeaway for our request is that launching the kickstarter in early summer will give an advantage to Louise's play being successfully funded.

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals
#### The most successful kickstarters for plays have goals in 2 ranges. The first range is under $5000 and the second is between $35000 to $45000. Therefore, Louise's play should have a better chance of being successfully funded if set in one of those 2 ranges.

### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered
- We need some more information from Louise. Notably that we don't know Louise's goal so contextually it's hard to know if we should tell her to increase or decrease her goal to improve her success chance.
- We could further breakdown the outcome vs goal groupings. There are still quite a few kickstarters in the $50000+ group.
- Other charts showing break down of outcome by country and break down by currency type could be valuable.
